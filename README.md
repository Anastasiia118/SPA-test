# **SPA Technical Test**

## **Project Description**

It's a simple Single Page Application created in order to prove the acquired hard skills needed for the position of junior/mid-frontend developer in OneRagtime company.

The application was build using Vue.js framework along with Vuex state management pattern & library. As for CSS, Tailwind framework was used to apply necessary styles. Additionally, Chart.js library along with vue-chartjs wrapper was utilised for data visualisation.

npm init vue@latest
```

## **Some Additional Info**

a. Two types of pagination were used in order to accomplish the test requirements : "maximum of 5 page links shown at any given time" and the option with "previos"/"next" button which expected to be disabled when needed.

b. Due to lack of real API with its endpoints, the provided json files were transformed into links (through GitHub Pages) as a way show the ability to use promises and error handling.
